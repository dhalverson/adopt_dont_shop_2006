# User Story 6, Shelter Delete
#
# As a visitor
# When I visit a shelter show page
# Then I see a link to delete the shelter
# When I click the link "Delete Shelter"
# Then a 'DELETE' request is sent to '/shelters/:id',
# the shelter is deleted,
# and I am redirected to the shelter index page where I no longer see this shelter
